* node-ipc example using unix socket || windows pipe

based on https://github.com/RIAEvangelist/node-ipc/blob/master/example/unixWindowsSocket/basic/

we want to put multiple sockets into a single directory;

assuming we have multiple clients and multiple servers, the clients need to
discover which servers are serving the app they are interested in; if none
exist, the client will do nothing.

run =node server.js= (or not) and =node client.js= for an interaction
